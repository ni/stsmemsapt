# STS MEMS Production TestProgram Example

The STS MEMS production TestProgram example contains a TestStand sequence and its LabVIEW source code showing the main measurements and tests performed on a MEMS device, like Continuity, Leakage, Resistance, Offset, Capacitance and Resonance.
The example has been tested using OfflineMode, simulating the hardware for an 8 site scenario and also in a 2 sites configuration with real hardware.

## Software Requirements
You must have the following software to use the STST MEMS Production TestProgram Example:
- STS Software Bundle 24.5.2 or later
